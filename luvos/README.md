## About LUV OS

LUV OS distribution provides a new level of support to developers identifying firmware implementation issues. Bringing together multiple separate upstream test suites into a cohesive and easy-to-use product with a unified reporting framework, LUV validates UEFI firmware at critical levels of the software stack.

LUV also provides tests in areas such as the interaction between the bootloader, Linux kernel and firmware. Integrated into one Linux distribution, firmware can be tested under conditions that are closer to real scenarios of operation.

For more information refer to [LUV OS documentation](https://01.org/linux-uefi-validation).

## Enterprise ACS on LUV OS

The Enterprise ACS uses the LUV infrastructure to test [SBSA](../sbsa/README.md) and [SBBR](../sbbr/README.md) compliance, as UEFI and Linux applications.
