# SBBR ACS Validation Methodology


## About the SBBR
    This Server Base Boot Requirements (SBBR) specification is intended for SBSA[2]-compliant 64-bit ARMv8 servers. It defines the base firmware requirements for out-of-box support of any ARM SBSA-compatible Operating System or hypervisor. The requirements in this specification are expected to be minimal yet complete for booting a multi-core ARMv8 server platform, while leaving plenty of room for OEM or ODM innovations and design details.

This specification is intended to be OS-neutral. It leverages the prevalent industry standard firmware specifications of UEFI and ACPI. Several changes in support of ARMv8 platforms have been submitted to the UEFI working groups of the ARM Bindings Sub Team (ABST) and the ACPI Specification Working Group (ASWG) for review, inclusion, and publication.

## Compliance Test Suite

SBBR compliance tests are self-checking, portable C-based tests which are based on the Server Base Boot Requirements specification. The test suite is divided into two components:

1. UEFI-SCT
2. Firmware Test Suite (FWTS)
3. SBSA
